									<h3>The Muse Behind MuseGit</h3>
									<p>In the current music world of the 21st century, most of the music work is computerized and digital while using various programs. More artists are working in a sophisticated studio and are advertising their music through social networks and various media sharing sites.
                                        Nowadays there is a need for a simple and efficient system that can help artists organize and manage their music from anywhere, as well as communicate and collaborate with other musicians - for this we set up the MuseGit platform.
                                        The MuseGit platform is a web application designed to provide artists around the world with an efficient, simple and free storage and versions management system.
                                        The platform will also provide a social collaboration system that will allow working together on music files between artists around the world, privately or publicly. The platform will also search partners and music by genres, instruments and location.</p>

							<p>According to our survey, most musicians are not active on similar platforms and would like to use our platform.
                                The inspiration for the project was taken from the software world where software people share code and manage versions on the Github website.
                                For future work, we will add a "Feed" - a system that will provide the artist with updates and innovations among the community and artists from around the world, as well a smart recommendations system that connect an artist with similar artists to create interesting and creative collaborations.
                                MuseGit will undertake to comply with copyright and user privacy standards and to use security tools that will prevent the theft of original content as much as possible.</p>
